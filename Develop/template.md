# Regular Expression Sytanx(Regex)

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tool used in programming to search, match and maniplate text within patterns. They are used in various languages for validating, parsing and transforming text. Each component of a regex serves a specific purpose, enabling complex and flexible pattern matching.

## Summary

This guide will walk you through the fundamental components of regular expressions, often used for data validation, string manipulation, and complex text parsing. And will cover the syntax and function of anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, and more, with examples to demonstrate each concept.

Here is an example of a regex

/^(\w+):\/\/([\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)+)(\/[\w- .\/?%&=]\*)?$/i

This reular expression is used to validate and parse URLs, breaking them down into protocol, domain, and optional path components.
